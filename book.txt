{chapter start Demonstrating Polyplot}

<h3>(a very short novel)</h3>

<br>

His new assignment wasn't sexy... Some technology demo for an interactive book company. "We want you, the famous adventure writer, to star in your own adventure", bla, bla, yada, yada. He had spent his whole life becoming a well-known adventure writer only to find that that didn't bring in nearly enough money to pay the rent. So he whored himself out for commercial gigs like this. 

"We've built a demo adventure environment that we want to show people. We'd like to send you and one of our best programmers into an adventure that shows off some of our technology." He gestured towards a young woman off to his left who had been observing him quietly. "This is Lisa, she will explain things as you move through the adventure." 

They continued chatting about how wonderful their new technology was for what seemed like eternity. He just wanted adventure and needed the money. These short demo-novels were never really adventurous, but at least they were short and you could be home in time for dinner. He made his way down the stairs with Lisa following.

As they were out on the street he stopped at the place around the corner to get a coffee. As he reached in his pocket for some change, some manbunned hipster started listing all the 45 kinds of coffee they had. He always had either regular coffee or decaf on days when regular coffee made him feel too wired. The choice suddenly reminded him of an interactive novel he read.. He wondered briefly what he felt like today and ...

{options coffee_options
	{option drank_coffee ... went for a regular coffee.}
	{option drank_decaf ... took the decaf.}
	{option drank_quadshot ... ordered a quad shot espresso.}
}

As he drank his coffee he tried not make his body language show how insulted he was that they had sent the girl with him. As if he hadn't always known what was going on just by briefly looking at any technology that was placed in front of him. Some programmer girl they plucked from behind her desk at Polyplot central, probably barely out of university. What the hell could she know about actual adventures?

{$counter = 0}

{anchor hallway}

{$counter++}

{if $counter >= 3: "This is the {print ordinal($counter)} time we're here," she said softly.} {if $counter == 3: "See that I'm saying third like 3<sup>rd</sup>? That's a little Javascript function I found online that turns a number into it's 'ordinal'. So I just put it in the book.js file and now I can say the numeric value of any variable like that."}

{if $room_1 || $room_2 || $room_3: He noticed he could see which doors they had already used because the options for them were purple instead of blue. "I guess everyone knows what that means from their browsers, he thought." Meanwhile the girl was muttering something about a check whether any rooms had been visited so the intro to the hallway could be skipped. He was bored with all this tech stuff. Why can't I just for once have a normal adventure?}

{else He ran up the stairs and shouted "Come on, faster!" as she panted up the second flight of stairs. "I want yo find out how this polyplot scripting stuff works."

{if $drank_quadshot: His heart pounded really, really fast and hard. Maybe the quad shot espresso had not been such an brilliant idea...} 
{if $drank_decaf: His head began to hurt and his mood turned slightly pissy and sour. A day without caffeine was not a good day...}

As she finally reached the top the stairs he turned around. They peered down a marble-clad hallway with some light coming from a skylight at the end. The three doors were conveniently marked with signs with the numbers one, two and three. "Well that's almost too corny", he thought. "What is this, a kid novel?"}

{options hallway_options
	{option door_1 Go to room one: {jump room_1}}
	{option door_2 Go to room two: {jump room_2}}
	{option door_3 Go to room three: {jump room_3}}
}


{anchor room_1}

This room's gold-coloured curtains and black carpet were definitely not his taste. But hey, at least it's clean here, not like downstairs. As he was still taking in the room the girl behind him started explaining the code underneath. "See, there was an option block that listed the doors, and each option had a jump after it. Everything that is not text to be printed in a polyplot novel is put in curly braces, and multiple block can be nested inside each other. It may take some getting used to, unless you're a programmer. We are quite used to nesting things in all sorts of brackets and braces. Technically the jump to this room wasn't even necessary as the text flow would have continued here without the jump as this is the first text after the option block. Sometimes it just reads cleaner though, especially if all the options are sort of equal as far as the story is concerned."

He had seen enough, this room isn't all that adventurous. He turned around for the door.

{jump hallway}



{anchor room_2}

The room behind door number two was unremarkable except for what looked like a young couple, seated at a table in the center of the room. When the woman spoke he noticed she spoke Russian.

<blockquote>По состоянию на 30 мая 2020 года португальский раздел Википедии содержит 1 033 787 статей, занимая по этому показателю 16 место среди всех языковых разделов Википедии.

Since he understood Russian, he could tell she was talking about the Portugese edition of Wikipedia, for whatever reason. The programmer stood next to him and gestured at the couple. "Did you see she spoke in a blockquote? They've been sitting here for years, only to show that you can insert any html or javascript right into the text of a novel. Can you imagine living your whole life in an upstairs room of some technology demo for an HTML tag?" He looked at the couple and they briefly glanced at him. He could feel their sadness sink into him just by looking at their eyes. The man finally spoke: "We are also supposed to tell you that you can put any style information in the book's css file. That's why the blockquote is only 80% of the regular font size." He spoke unnaturally slowly, but in perfect english.

He shook his head at the sadness of the scene and while he looked away noticed a painting on the wall. Almost Dali-like, he thought. But no time for that, he needed to learn more about Polyplot. She was already ahead of him and headed out the door again.

{jump hallway}



{anchor room_3}

This is room 3

"Wow, this room is dusty" he thought.

{if $room_2: Then he suddenly remembers the painting from room 2. The girl looks at him. "It's not a real memory you know... Underneath us in the Polyplot basement, every option you choose and every anchor you pass turns on a variable by the same name. This is so that authors never need to set any variables manually if all you want to do is keep track of where you have been or what choices you have made. All we needed to do for this memory was to start with "\{if $room_2: " and end with a "\}". 

"But didn't you say everything in curly braces gets translated by polyplot? Then how come you could say something with a curly brace in it?" She smiled and realised that he was smarter than she had given him credit for. "Polyplot ignores curly braces if you put a "\" character in front of it. I actually coded that when I needed it for this paragraph." He looked at her and figured she must be used to it, but for him it still felt very weird to be touring a literary environment with the programmer that made it. A bit like taking a stroll with God.}

"Jump out of the window, if you wanna see something cool," she said.

"Excuse me?"

He walked over to the window and peered down. A good 10 meter drop on concrete, jumping out would kill him.

"Dying is the whole point. If you jump out of the window now the story ends, and then you can revisit all your previous choices, it's kinda cool." she said. 

{options jump_options
	{option jump Oh sure. What the hell. Let's see what happens...:{jump death}}
	{option dont_jump No way! I'm not dying here just to demo some interactive book-tech!}
}

"Nah", he said... "Not now, I don't want to die just yet." He turned around and walked to the door going back to the hallway.

{jump hallway}

{anchor death}

His body hit the concrete and he died. (Yes, this dying scene can be much more elaborate...)

The End
